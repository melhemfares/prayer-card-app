# Prayer Card Android App

In the Christian tradition, holy cards or prayer cards are small, devotional pictures for the use of the faithful that usually depict a religious scene or a saint in an image about the size of a playing card. The reverse typically contains a prayer, some of which promise an indulgence for its recitation.

## Lessons Learned

I've dabbled with React before, but this was my first time using React Native and also my first time developing a mobile app. I also learned how to upload and process images by storing the images in an Amazon S3 bucket, which provided me with public image URLs to store in the database.
